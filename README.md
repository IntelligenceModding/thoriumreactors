The ThoriumReactors Mod is a Minecraft modification that introduces a new type of energy generation in the game - thorium reactors. 
Harness the power of thorium to generate sustainable and efficient energy for your Minecraft world!

## Features

- Explore the depths of the underground and find up to 11 ores and minerals.
- Build your own thorium reactor. Fuel the reactor and let the magical powers of physics play
- Monitor your whole reactor with the big control interface to ensure stability, efficiency and continuous power generation.
- Use the generated steam to power up your Turbine for endless power generation.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisites:** Make sure you have Minecraft Forge installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from the [Official Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) website.

2. **Download:** Download the latest version of the Thorium Reactor Mod from the releases section at [Curseforge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thorium-reactors/files/).

3. **Installation:** Copy the downloaded mod file to the mods folder in your Minecraft installation directory. If the mods folder doesn't exist, create it.

4. **Launch Minecraft:** Launch the Minecraft launcher and select the Forge profile.

5. **Enjoy:** Start a new game or load an existing one and enjoy the power of thorium in Minecraft!

**Recommendation:** Use the Curseforge launcher to easily create Modpacks, install Mods and manage them!

## Usage

1. **Collect your elements:** Make sure to have enough elements to build and power the thorium reactor. The fundamental elements are uranium and thorium.

2. **Building the Reactor:** Use the reactor casings, glass, rod controllers, reactor core, valves and the reactor controller to build up your own thorium reactor. Ensure you have enough space around the reactor for proper operation.

3. **Molten Salt:** Before using the reactor in any way, you need to fill up the inner of the reactor with Molten Salt using the valves. *Warning: Do not place fluids inside the reactor*

4. **Fueling the Reactor:** Insert your depleted uranium and thorium into the reactor, afterwards, you are ready to go and produce heat.

5. **Using the Heat:** For transfering the Heated Molten Salt, you need thermal fluid pipes. For this you need to make the  ***Inconel 625*** alloy with many ores and blasting processes. Then you can exchange the molten salts heat into fluids like water to produce steam.

6. **Generating Power:** Using the produced steam, your turbine will produce massive amounts of energy. Make sure to tap everything of it. Energy overflow is been voided.

7. **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Keep an eye on the reactor's temperature, turbine- and fuel rod status. Replace depleted fuel promptly to avoid power outages or potential problems.
